# Sarge Apper Devops Technical Challenge Cloudformation Templates and Deployment Manifests 

![Branding](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C510BAQHAhem3MAGMOw/company-logo_100_100/0/1548069481911?e=1619654400&v=beta&t=RMd-5dJ-YxQ475FznaYdeTFtQLf1NPNGCIw8g_Z5q-8) 

## Prerequisites:

You need to have the following in order for the provisioning scripts to work:

* AWS IAM User key pair - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
* AWS CLI v2 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html
* ECS CLI - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI_installation.html

## Steps to provision core resources(VPC, RDS, IAM Roles/Policies, ECS, PyPlate CF Macro and Lambda handler, Certificates, ECS Cluster)

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone ssh://git-codecommit.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/sarge-cfn-templates

cd sarge-cfn-templates

```

2. Create an s3 bucket. This is needed to store the packaged Cloudformation templates

```
BUCKET_NAME=enter_your_bucket_name # e.g. sarge-cfn
 # Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html
AWS_PROFILE=enter_your_aws_profile_reference
aws s3api create-bucket \
--bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
--region ap-southeast-1 \
--profile $AWS_PROFILE \
--create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-southeast-1
```

3. Once the s3 bucket is ready, you can package the CFN templates. NOTE: this is a nested stack

```
BUCKET_NAME=enter_your_bucket_name # e.g. sarge-cfn
 # Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html
AWS_PROFILE=enter_your_aws_profile_reference
aws cloudformation package \
--template-file template.yaml \
--output-template packaged.yaml \
--s3-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
--profile $AWS_PROFILE
```

4. Deploy the packaged cfn template `template.yaml`

```
aws cloudformation deploy \
--stack-name SargeCommon-stack \
--template-file packaged.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--profile apper_challenge
```

## Steps to provision Tier1 Challenge(Elastic Beanstalk)

1. Clone the sarge-express-miniapp repo

```
git clone ssh://git-codecommit.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/sarge-express-miniapp

cd sarge-express-miniapp
```

2. Using eb cli tool, initialize a new elastic beanstalk config 

```
# Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html
AWS_PROFILE=enter_your_aws_profile_reference 

eb init --profile $AWS_PROFILE

# Select a default region: 7 - ap-southeast-1
# Select [ Create new Application ]
# Enter Application Name: Any name you want
# Select a platform.: 7 - Node.js
# Select a platform branch: 1 - Node.js 14 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2
# Do you wish to continue with CodeCommit? (Y/n): Y (But it's up to you if you want to use other repositories)
# Select  a repository: Up to you
```

3. After initializing eb config, create a new environment with sample app

```
eb create --sample --vpc
```

4. Set the necessary environment variables. You can check the host name at your provisioned RDS instanec

```
# Replace the values
PASSWORD=somedbpassword
HOST=somedbisntance.c4abcdef1234.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com
eb setenv PASSWORD=$PASSWORD USERNAME=sarge DATABASE=sarge HOST=$HOST
```

5. After you set the necessary env vars, you can now deploy the app

```
eb deploy
```


&nbsp;
* What you will build should satisfy the challenge statement/requirements.
&nbsp;
* Your code should be human readable and uses intellectual words.
&nbsp;
* We at Apper, take code organization and application architecture quite seriously.
&nbsp;
* The challenge are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience required to complete them.
  **Note**: *It's ok not to finish all of them but completing higher tier is very much encourage.*
&nbsp;
* Keep in touch with us and feel free to message us for questions and clarifications.

## The Challenge

Challenges are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.

| Tier | DevOps Profile                                                                                                                                                |
| :--: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | DevOps in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically experienced deploying user-facing applications such as nodejs apps, ruby web apps, and php laravel apps on virtual machines or in cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure or Heroku. Someone who can leverage ElasticBeanstalk. Also has deep knowledge on Linux Fundamentals and Databases that can leverage AWS RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL and etc. Basic understanding on AWS basic services such as  VPC, Security Groups, S3, Route53, Cloudfront, Application Load Balancer, EC2 and IAM.                |
|  2   | DevOps at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. Deep understanding on Docker and Containerization. Can deploy containerize apps or api services on Amazon ECS. They are comfortable in automation tools such as Cloudformation or Terraform and Docker. Comfortable using development tools such as AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeCommit and CodeDeploy for CI/CD. Have experience automating applications using scripts and other third party libraries. |
|  3   | DevOps who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing microservices applications using Kubernetes and can leverage AWS EKS                   |


## Requirements
**ðŸŒŸ What Youâ€™ll need to build ðŸŒŸ**

This repository includes a simple and very minimal express nodejs app in the root directory (**./express-minapp**). What you need to do is use this user-facing application and deploy it on AWS. AWS Account will be provided by apper.ph. The deployment and infrastructure varies differently on each tier. Please refer to the diagram and instructions on each tier.

**ðŸŒŸ What you are encouraged to use and our judging criteria ðŸŒŸ**

Automation and CI/CD are the heart of DevOps. So you're encourage to use development tools, CI/CD tools and automation tools accordingly at all times.
